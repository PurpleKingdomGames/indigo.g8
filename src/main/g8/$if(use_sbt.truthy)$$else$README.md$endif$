## Getting started with Mill

The repo contains a version of the [millw](https://github.com/lefou/millw) launch script, so even if you have Mill installed globably, you're advised to use run Mill as `./mill <commands>`.

Below is a list of useful commands, including some generally useful ones in case you're new to Mill.

> Note that if you're using zsh, you may need to surround argument groups with single quotes, if you have special characters like hypens in your project name.
